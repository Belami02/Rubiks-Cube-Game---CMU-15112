Rubik's Cube Game (https://youtu.be/6Zqn3_BwyEw)

Description: 
------------
This project aims to develop a 2D version of the classic 3D puzzle game, commonly known as the Rubik's Cube or Magic Cube. Unlike the traditional 3D model, this version will display the cube in a 2D plane, consisting of six colored sections that can be rotated similarly to the 3D cube. Each section contains nine smaller squares, arranged in three rows and columns. The objective is for the player to solve the puzzle by making each section uniformly colored, thereby enhancing their problem-solving skills. I also implemented an isometric view of the cube which somehow looks like a 3D version.

Module List:
------------
- CMU Graphics.
- Standard(builtin) Python libraries for data handling and logic implementation.
- CSV
- PIL(additional feature under development)

Running the project:
------------

To run my game, you have to download all files within this zip folder and put them together in the same folder and run file named "runGame.py"

Rotation Shortcuts:
------------
- Rotate Front Face: F - Rotates the front face anticlockwise, Shift + F for clockwise.
- Rotate Back Face: A - Rotates the back face anticlockwise, Shift + A for clockwise.
- Rotate Right Face: R - Rotates the right face anticlockwise, Shift + R for clockwise.
- Rotate Left Face: L - Rotates the left face anticlockwise, Shift + L for clockwise.
- Rotate Top Face: T - Rotates the top face anticlockwise, Shift + T for clockwise.
- Rotate Bottom Face: B - Rotates the bottom face anticlockwise, Shift + B for clockwise.
- Rotate Middle Layer: M - Rotates the middle layer anticlockwise, Shift + M for clockwise.
- Rotate Equator Layer: E - Rotates the bottom face anticlockwise, Shift + E for clockwise.
- Additional feature(picture mode): N -- This is under development.

Features:
------------

- Interactive 3D Rubik's Cube: Manipulate the cube with mouse clicks or keyboard inputs.
- Scramble and Solve Functions: Easily scramble the cube and attempt to solve it, with functionality to solve step-by-step.
- User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive controls including buttons for scrambling, resetting, and changing views.
- Advanced Visual Features: Experimental feature to apply images to the cube's faces, offering a unique twist to the classic gameplay.
